                The hip hop world was shaken on the morning of November 2nd to learn that Takeoff, a rapper most notably
                known for his membership in the musical trio Migos, was fatally shot. Born as ​​Kirshnik Khari Ball,
                Takeoff
                was 28 years old when he was shot outside of a private party he was attending in Houston.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the time of his death, Migos was no longer performing together, but Takeoff had created a dynasty
                with
                his uncle Quavo and first cousin once removed Offset in the hip hop industry.

                nearly 50 million U.S. on-demand streams, according to Billboard. Hit songs like “Bad and Boujee,” “Stir
                Fry,” and “Walk It Talk It,” saw increases of up to 93% or 3.7 million official streams. When “Bad and
                Boujee” was released in 2017, it locked in the No. 1 spot for three straight weeks on the Billboard Hot
                100 chart.

                For some late artists, their passing leads to <b> milestones never achieved during their career.</b>
                Rock legend
                David Bowie had been performing for the greater part of the second half of the 20th century, but it
                wasn’t until he died that he had a No. 1 album in the United States, according to CNBC. Days before he
                died of cancer, Bowie released “Blackstar,” the album that took him to the No. 1 spot on Billboard
                charts the week after.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarded as a music icon of the 20th century, Bowie had a well decorated career while he was alive. His
                song “Fame” hit the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 list and stayed there for two weeks. “Let’s
                Dance” got the same recognition eight years later in 1983 and remained in the top spot for one week.

                When DMX died of an overdose in 2021, U.S. streams increased 928% in the two days following his death
                compared to the two days before. In the days leading up to his passing, streams were already increasing,
                following the news of his hospitalization one week prior. Before getting hospitalized on April 2, 2021,
                his songs were streamed about 1 million times per day. Between April 3 and April 8, they rose to between
                3 and 4 million per day.

                The death of Michael Jackson in 2009 led to policy changes for how Billboard categorized their top
                charts, proving the magnitude of listeners who tune into the voice of those who’ve passed. Previously,
                Billboard would remove any album over 2 years old from their top 200 album chart. When Jackson died,
                however, they were forced to remove this policy following the increase in sales for “Thriller” and
                “Number Ones,” which became the two top-selling albums in the United States. Billboard acknowledged
                their success, placing them on the chart.

                For others, the sudden passing can change the narrative surrounding their sound. John Lennon created
                hits as a member of the Beatles for over a decade, but his album “Double Fantasy,” which was produced
                with Yoko Ono, received minimal sales and not-so-great reviews. However, when Lennon was murdered three
                weeks after its release, the album immediately jumped to the No. 1 spot and stayed there for two months.

            <p>Lennon had preached this idea in his 1974 song, “Nobody Loves You (When You’re Down and Out), where he
                said: “Everybody loves you when you’re six foot underground.” An eerie prediction of how admiration
                continues and even increases after death. </p>
            <p><b>This idea has been widely studied by psychologists and discussed throughout society: </b> people
                become loved
                after they’re dead. Mara Schwartz Kuge, founder and president of Superior Music Copr., told CNBC that
                the increase in album sales or song streams after an artist dies can be attributed to grief, curiosity
                or both. The increased exposure of their name in headlines leads a lot of people to look them up again,
                whether they were fans before hearing the news or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                For those who were, a lot of it is tuning into the nostalgia associated with that artist. When they die
                after a long, successful career, listening to their old hits can bring back fond memories for their
                fans. It’s also their way to mourn them, paying a tribute by pressing play in place of going to the
                private funeral. In a lot of the cases discussed here, the death’s were sudden and tragic. Audiences
                were typically young and felt a connection to these artists, who no longer have the option to write
                another song or perform another show.

            </p>
            <p>
                Ian Drew, consumer editorial director at Billboard, had a similar conversation with USA TODAY, adding
                that the shock of a sudden death generates curiosity, inspiring an initial search for their name and
                eventually their music.
