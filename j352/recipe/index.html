        <li>4 Gala apples, peeled, cores removed and sliced in 1/2 inch thickness</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sweet butter</li>
        <li>1 cup Orange Marmalade or Jam</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Calvados</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Preperation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375F</li>
        <li>Place hazelnuts on a cookie sheet and roast in hot oven for <br>
            7-8 minuts. Transfer nuts to a food processor, add the 1/4 <br>
            cup sugar, egg, butter and vanilla extract. Process until creamy <br>
            past forms </li>
        <li>Roll out the puff pastry to 15 inches long by 10 inches wide. <br>
            Transfer to a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Spread the <br>
            frangipane on the dough stopping about 1 1/2 inch away from the <br>
            edges.</li>
        <li>Arrange the apple slices over the frangipane on an overlapping <br>
            pattern to cover well the frangipane underneath. Fold the edge of <br>
            the dough over the apples to make a 1 1/2 inch border.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 2-3 tbsp sugar over the apples letting some of <br>
            the sugar sprinkled over the border dough. Break the 2 tbsp <br>
            of sweet butter and scatter them over the apples. Bake for 1 hour <br>
            the dough should be nicely crystalized all over</li>
        <li>Remove the finished tart from the oven and cool on a wire rack <br>
            until still a bit warm to the touch. Mix together the orange <br>
            marmalade with the Calvados and glaze the surface of the tart<br>
            speading it carefully on the apples and the border crust. Use the <br>
            back of the spoon to easily spread</li>
        <li>Serve at room temperature cut into small wedges. Serve with <br>
            whipping cream or ice cream</li>
    </ol>
