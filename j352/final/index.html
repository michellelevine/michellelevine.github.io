            <p>
                The hip hop world was shaken on the morning of November 2nd to learn that Takeoff, a rapper most notably
                known for his membership in the musical trio Migos, was fatally shot. Born as ​​Kirshnik Khari Ball,
                Takeoff
                was 28 years old when he was shot outside of a private party he was attending in Houston.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the time of his death, Migos was no longer performing together, but Takeoff had created a dynasty
                with
                his uncle Quavo and first cousin once removed Offset in the hip hop industry.

            <p>Above, Takeoff performs “Stir Fry” on SNL on March 4, 2018 with Migos. In the seven days following
                Takeoff’s death, Migos’ song catalog reached 56.6 million U.S. on-demand streams, up 182.2% from the
                20.1 million streams the week prior. Streams for Takeoff’s solo work increased by 434.9%, reaching
                nearly 50 million U.S. on-demand streams, according to Billboard. Hit songs like “Bad and Boujee,” “Stir
                Fry,” and “Walk It Talk It,” saw increases of up to 93% or 3.7 million official streams. When “Bad and
                Boujee” was released in 2017, it locked in the No. 1 spot for three straight weeks on the Billboard Hot
                100 chart.
