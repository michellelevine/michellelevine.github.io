        <h5>Below are the various forms of written and visual projects I've worked on, both in class and during
            internships</h5>

        <h4>Street Sense Media</h4>
        <a
            href="https://www.streetsensemedia.org/article/dc-programs-connect-job-seekers-and-employers-during-national-hiring-struggles/#.Y1GF-C-B28V">Connecting
            the national labor shortage to joblessness in D.C. </a> | Oct. 20, 2021
        <ul>
            <li>
                I spent months speaking with various business owners, members of job boards and committees and people
                without jobs in the greater DC area with the goal of uncovering the disconnect. I was just beginning to
                scratch at the surface of a much larger, systemic issue of America's economy.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <a
            href="https://www.streetsensemedia.org/article/new-anacostia-center-improves-access-to-health-care-but-nearby-residents-unaware-hesitant-to-change/#.Y1GHOi-B28U">Increasing
            access to health care in Anocastia doesn't lead to direct use </a> | Dec. 8, 2021
        <ul>
            <li>
                After covering the opening of a new, full service health care center located in underserved Wards 7 and
                8, I followed up with the center's director, a few of their doctors and several patients to understand
                why the brand new center was going unused. The answer: hesitancy from a population that is largely
                underserved and therefore skeptical of medicine.
            </li>
            <li>
                This was one of the pieces where I got to exercise my visual editorial skills; included is about a
                one-minute video of compiled interviews, giving readers a chance to hear directly from the community.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Truth Initiative</h4>
        <a
            href="https://truthinitiative.org/research-resources/tobacco-prevention-efforts/qa-how-hispanic-serving-institution-became-tobacco">Talking
            through the importance of tobacco prevention measures at a Hispanic Serving Institution </a> | Oct. 14, 2022
        <ul>
            <li>
                In honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, my supervisor and I collaborated on an interview with one of our
                partners to discuss how tobacco companies typically target marganalized demographics and why it's so
                important to push back.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Journalism 262: News Videography </h4>
        <p>
            In the midst of online classes and virtual events in the spring of 2021, I gained videography and editing
            skills with standard DSLR cameras and Adobe Suite applications such as Bridge and Premiere Pro. Below is my
            final project for the class, where I highlighted the perserverance of the University of Maryland Women's
            Club Lacrosse Team and their efforts to continue playing throughout the pandemic.
