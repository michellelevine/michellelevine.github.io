    <p>The Oktoberfest is the world's largest Volkfest, featuring a beer festival <br>
        and a traveling funfair. It is held annually in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. It is a 16-18 day folk festival
        running from mid or late September <br>
        to around the first Sunday in October, with more than six million international and national visitors attending
        the event. Locally, it is called <br>
        d'Wiesn, after the colloquial name for the fairgrounds, Theresienwiese. The Oktoberfest is an important part of
        Bavarian culture, having been <br>
        held since the year 1810.Other cities across the world also hold Oktoberfest celebrations that are modeled after
        the original Munich event.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the event, large quantities of Oktoberfest Beer are consumed. For example, during the 16-day festival in
        2014, 7.7 million litres <br>(66,000 US bbl; 1,700,000 imp gal) were served,[1] making it the year where the
        most beer was consumed at the Oktoberfest.[2] Visitors also senjoy numerous attractions, such as amusement
        rides, sidestalls, and games. There is also a wide variety of traditional foods available.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Munich Oktoberfest originally took place in the 16-day period leading up to the first Sunday in October. In
        1994, this longstanding <br> schedule was modified in response to German reunification. As a result, if the
        first Sunday in October falls on the 1st or the 2nd, then the <br>festival would run until 3 October (German
        Unity Day). Thus, the festival now runs for 17 days when the first Sunday is 2 October and 18<br> days when it
        is 1 October. In 2010, the festival lasted until the first Monday in October (4 October), to mark the event's
        bicentennial.
